I.  Introduction to Frustration
    A.  What is frustration
        1.  comparison with non-frustrated (Neel) AFM
        2.  Toy classical example (the AFM triangle or some analog)
    B.  Why study it
        1.  Quantum Spin liquids
        2.  Novel behavior there (e.g. anyons)
    C.  Where do we see it
        1.  Any corner-sharing lattice of frustrated simplices

II. Kagome as a particular frustrated lattice
    A.  Is it practical anyway
        1.  There are several real materials (check original poster abstract)
    B.  What do we know about it
        1.  Proposals for S = 1/2
        2.  Speculation about S = 3/2, S = 1
        3.  Field theory studies
    C.  What don't we know about it
        1.  Most properties for S > 1/2, exact properties for S = 1/2
        2.  the best variational wave function
    D.  Why don't we know that?
        1.  It's hard :(
        2.  Hilbert spaces are huge (pickin ain't easy)
        3.  Loops, man, loops (the loop is a killer)

III.What are we doing -- killer cacti
    A.  The cactus
        1.  Why?  No loops!
        2.  Previous uses
        3.  What is already known
    B.  DMRG on teh cactus
        1.  The algorithm O(M^4)
        2.  The algorithm O(M^3) (if time to make the diagram)
    C.  A slightly more complicated H
        1.  Heisenberg and on-site anisotropy
        2.  Proposed phase diagram

IV. Preliminary results for S = 1
    A.  XY Ferromag
    B.  Disordered Quantum Paramag
    C.  Correlation Function Scaling
    D.  120 Deg States, 3-coloring
    
V.  The Future: S > 1
    A.  Preliminary Isotropic J results
