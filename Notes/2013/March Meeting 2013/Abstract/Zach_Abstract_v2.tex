\begin{abstract}
The Kagome quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet is a prime candidate for the realization of a quantum spin liquid. Though many of the experimental realizations of this model have $S>1/2$, theoretical and computational studies for these spin values have proven difficult. To study this larger spin regime, we consider the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet for $S\ge1/2$ on the Husimi cactus, a graph of corner sharing triangles each of whose centers is a vertex of a Bethe lattice. Our method is a DMRG procedure tailored for tree graphs $[$1$]$ and is thus well suited to our models; by contrast, such $S>1/2$ models are virtually intractable by exact diagonalization on the kagome lattice.

Our focus is the possible transition(s) as $S$ is increased from a spin liquid at $S=1/2$ to the coplanar ordered state known to be stable in the large $S$ limit $[$2$]$. Since the geometry is like the Kagome lattice locally, properties dominated by nearest-neighbor spin correlations should be captured by the same interactions on the Husimi cactus; on the other hand, the cactus lacks loops, so properties dependent on them cannot be captured.  As a proof of principle we also investigate the quantum XXZ model with on-site anisotropy for $S=1$, and compare it to previous work $[$3$]$.
