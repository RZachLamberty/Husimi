I.  Motivation / Intro
    
    A.  Kagome and large spins
        
        1.  S = 1/2, Elser & Zeng, Yan White and Huse
        2.  S = 1, Xu & Moore / Isakov and Kim
        3.  S = 3/2, Lauchli
        4.  S = 5/2, ?
        5.  Large S, Sachdev
        6.  List real materials where they exist
    
    B.  Large spins difficult, exponential hilbert spaces, etc.
    
    C.  DMRG can be applied to any loopless hierarchical system
    
    D.  Husimi Cactus is an option (has been used before as well, Elser (and Zeng?) )
    
    E.  Spin liquid state expected for S = 1/2, but known to be ordered for large
        S ( Doucot and Simon, Chandra and Doucot, etc )

II. Method
    
    A.  DMRG (cite White)
    B.  Picture
    C.  Hierarchical lattice is all we need

III.Results
    
    0.  Expectations for Cactus
        
        1.  Large S ( Doucot papers again, maybe Sachdev )
        2.  Small S (does it exist?  Elser maybe?)
        3.  Scaling of correlation functions in ordered states
    
    A.  Heisenberg Point
    
        1.  S = 1
            a.  Picture here, probably
        
        2.  S = 2
        
        3.  Table of "values" obtained this way.
    
    B.  Spin = 1, Elsewhere in the Jx / d plane
        
        1.  Comparison to Isakov et al.
            a.  Several plots here
        
        2.  Comparison to Moore and others ( if possible )


IV. Speculation / Conclusions
    
    A.  I have none.  Would like to plot the transition as a function of spin
        size.  This will be hard.
